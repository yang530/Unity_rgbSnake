# Unity Game: RGB Snake
This is an Unity Game I made in 2016 for a Gamejam contest in China.

## How to Use/Import
1. All the assets of the project (including scripts, materials, resources and scene etc.) are in the asset folder.
2. The exported package is the "Exported Packages" folder.
3. Either drag and drop all files in the asset folder into unity or import the package in the development environment in Unity.

## Game Overview

Reimagination of the classic snake game.

*The Game is powered by the Unity engine.
*Use arrow keys or left click the screen to control snake.
*Hold mouse or arrow key to speed up snake movement.
*Eat food in color similar to the snake to gain points. Eating food will affect color of the snake
*Some special foods change color over time.
*More food the snake eat, the longer it gets. The longer the snake, the more points you gain from food.
*Eating food too different in color to snake will cause snake to shrink!
*Value in lower left corner display the color of the snake in RGB value.
*Game ends when snake hits a wall or no more food on the map.

Thanks for playing!
