## Game Overview

Reimagination of the classic snake game.

*The Game is powered by the Unity engine.
*Use arrow keys or left click the screen to control snake.
*Hold mouse or arrow key to speed up snake movement.
*Eat food in color similar to the snake to gain points. Eating food will affect color of the snake
*Some special foods change color over time.
*More food the snake eat, the longer it gets. The longer the snake, the more points you gain from food.
*Eating food too different in color to snake will cause snake to shrink!
*Value in lower left corner display the color of the snake in RGB value.
*Game ends when snake hits a wall or no more food on the map.

Thanks for playing!
